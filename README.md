MS-DOS TSR to set up a hotkey to force display mode 03h (co80) using a hotkey combo, while maintaining display memory contents (in the text-mode area B800:0000). 
This is needed on the Bell Alex Telecomputer when using an EGA card, as the included software enters an incompatible display mode on startup.
